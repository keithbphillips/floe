# Fullscreen Mode

JustWrite now includes a true fullscreen mode for complete immersion in your writing!

## 🖥️ What is Fullscreen Mode?

Fullscreen mode takes over your entire screen, hiding:
- Window title bar and borders
- Windows taskbar
- Desktop background
- All other applications
- System notifications (when focused)

**Result:** Just you and your words. Complete distraction-free writing.

## ⌨️ How to Use

### Enter Fullscreen
Press **`F11`**

### Exit Fullscreen
Press **`F11`** again or **`Escape`**

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Maximum Focus
1. Start JustWrite
2. Press `F11` to enter fullscreen
3. Optional: Enable Focus Mode (`Ctrl+F`)
4. Optional: Switch to Dark Mode (`Ctrl+D`)
5. Write without distractions!

### Quick Access While in Fullscreen
All keyboard shortcuts still work:
- `Escape` - Exit fullscreen (or show file menu if not in fullscreen)
- `Ctrl+S` - Save As
- `Ctrl+O` - Open
- `Ctrl+,` - Settings
- `Ctrl+D` - Dark/Light mode
- `Ctrl+F` - Focus mode

## 💡 Tips

### The Ultimate Distraction-Free Setup
Combine these features for maximum immersion:

1. **Fullscreen** (`F11`) - Hides everything
2. **Dark Mode** (`Ctrl+D`) - Easy on the eyes
3. **Focus Mode** (`Ctrl+F`) - Highlights current sentence
4. **Large Font** (Settings) - Comfortable reading
5. **Auto-Save** (automatic) - Never worry about losing work

### Writing Sessions
- Enter fullscreen at the start of your writing session
- Use `Escape` briefly if you need the file menu
- Stay in fullscreen until you're done
- Exit with `F11` or `Escape`

### Multi-Monitor Setup
- Fullscreen takes over one monitor
- Use other monitors for research, notes, etc.
- JustWrite fills the selected screen completely
