========================================
ENABLE WINDOWS DEVELOPER MODE
========================================

Flutter requires Developer Mode to be enabled on Windows for building apps.
This is a one-time setting that allows Flutter to create symbolic links.

HOW TO ENABLE:

Option 1 - Using Settings GUI:
1. Press Windows Key
2. Type "Developer Settings" and press Enter
3. OR run this command to open it directly:
   start ms-settings:developers
4. Toggle "Developer Mode" to ON
5. Confirm any prompts
6. Wait for Windows to apply the changes (may take a minute)

Option 2 - Quick Open:
Press Win+R and paste this:
ms-settings:developers

Then toggle Developer Mode to ON.

WHAT THIS DOES:
- Allows apps to create symbolic links (required by Flutter)
- Enables other developer tools
- Does NOT affect system security when used with trusted apps like Flutter
- This is a Microsoft-recommended setting for developers

AFTER ENABLING:
Close your terminal and reopen it, then run:
  build_windows.bat

Or manually:
  flutter build windows --release

========================================

If you're concerned about security:
Developer Mode is safe when you're only building your own apps.
You can disable it after building if you prefer, but you'll need to
re-enable it each time you want to build.
